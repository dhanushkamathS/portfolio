    `Have you ever witnessed a crime where the detective is trying to solve a crime? The twist is that the detective is the culprit. This sums up the life of a programmer trying the solve the error created by him.`,
    `It’s a very frustrating feeling when you know something is wrong but cannot quite put a finger on it. Once you solve it, the dopamine rush in the head is something that can’t be put into words.`,
    `I have been solving crimes for over three years now. A full stack developer, react native, and DevOps. From building a simple web page to building a complex backend on the cloud, I’m the man for the job. Stackover flow, google, and GitHub is my best friends.`,
    `Love contributing to open source and giving back to the developer community.`
